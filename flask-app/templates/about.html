    <p><b>What is this?</b></p>
    <p>This is a fake news site that uses artificial intelligence to generate false news and commentary.
        Throughout the day, it automatically generates and publishes fake articles on topical subjects.
        The articles on this site are not written, edited, or curated by humans. Everything is automated.</p>
    <br>
    <p><b>Why make this?</b></p>
    <p>We built this site to raise awareness of the threat from fake news generated by artificial intelligence.
        Recent advances in AI have made it cheap and easy to automatically generate realistic fake news stories
        (<a href="https://d4mucfpksywv.cloudfront.net/better-language-models/language_models_are_unsupervised_multitask_learners.pdf">Radford
            et al., 2019</a>; <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.12616.pdf">Zellers et al.,
            2019</a>), and these methods could easily be used for malicious purposes.</p>
    <p>Bad actors could use this technology to generate realistic fake content on an unprecedented scale. Unlike
        human propagandists, AI algorithms can create fake stories in truly massive quantities, potentially
        flooding the internet with fake content. In an environment where fake news already spreads farther and
        faster than the truth (<a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/359/6380/1146">Vosoughi et al.,
            2018</a>), fake stories could soon outnumber real ones, at a fraction of the cost.</p>

    <p>Researchers have started to develop algorithms to automatically detect if text was generated by AI or
        written by a human (<a href="http://gltr.io">Gehrmann et al., 2019</a>), but there is no purely
        technical solution to this problem. Algorithms will never be able to detect fake text perfectly, and
        generators are likely to get more reliable and better at avoiding detection. Addressing the dangers of
        AI-generated fake text will require collaboration between academia, industry, and government to raise
        awareness, develop mitigations, establish ethical guidelines, and deter malicious behavior.</p>
    <br>
    <p><b>Doesn't this site just make the problem worse?</b></p>
    <p>We think the chances are low that this site will be misused. All of the content is clearly marked as
        machine generated. Additionally, the algorithm that we use to generate fake articles is already <a
                href="https://grover.allenai.org/">easily accessible</a> and offers more control on its own than
        this site does. This site also does not generate enough fake content to save anyone a meaningful amount of
        money or computing power if they were trying to create large quantities of fake news.</p>
    <p>Still, we believe that developers and researchers should carefully consider the ethical impact of
        their work. If you have concerns about this site, please <a href="/contact-us">contact us.</a></p>
    <br>
    <p><b>How does the site work?</b></p>
    <p>To generate articles, this site uses the Grover Mega model from <a
            href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.12616.pdf">Zellers et
        al.</a> Throughout the day, the site pulls real headlines from the internet and uses them to seed
        Grover so that it generates fake articles on subjects in today’s headlines. To generate op-eds and other
        commentary, the site seeds Grover with editorials and configures it to produce text in the style of outlets
        with strong political leanings. </p>

    <p>Once the site generates an article, it matches that article with an image using <a
            href="https://cse.google.com/cse/">Google’s custom search engine API</a>.</p>
