        <p><b>What is this?</b></p>
        <p>This is a fake news site that uses artificial intelligence to generate news and commentary.
            Throughout the day, it automatically generates and publishes brand new fake articles on topical subjects.
            The articles on this site are not written, edited, or curated by humans. Everything is automated.</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>Why make this?</b></p>
        <p>We built this site to raise awareness of the threat from fake news generated by artificial intelligence.
            Recent advances in AI have made it cheap and easy to automatically generate realistic fake news stories
            (<a href="https://d4mucfpksywv.cloudfront.net/better-language-models/language_models_are_unsupervised_multitask_learners.pdf">Radford
                et al., 2019</a>; <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.12616.pdf">Zellers et al.,
                2019</a>), and these methods could easily be used for malicious purposes.</p>
        <p>Bad actors could use this technology to generate realistic fake content on an unprecedented scale. Unlike
            human propagandists, AI algorithms can create fake stories in truly massive quantities, potentially
            flooding the internet with fake content. In an environment where fake news already spreads farther and
            faster than the truth (<a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/359/6380/1146">Vosoughi et al.,
                2018</a>), fake stories could soon outnumber real ones, at a fraction of the cost.</p>

        <p>Researchers have started to develop algorithms to automatically detect if text was generated by AI or
            written by a human (<a href="http://gltr.io">Gehrmann et al., 2019</a>), but there is no purely
            technical solution to this problem. Algorithms will never be able to detect fake text perfectly, and
            generators are likely to get more reliable and better at avoiding detection. Addressing the dangers of
            AI-generated fake text will require collaboration between academia, industry, and government to raise
            awareness, develop mitigations, establish ethical guidelines, and deter malicious behavior.</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>Doesn't this site just make the problem worse?</b></p>
        <p>We think the chances are low that this site will be misused. All of the content is clearly marked as
            machine generated. Additionally, the algorithm that we use to generate fake articles is already <a
                    href="https://grover.allenai.org/">easily accessible</a> and offers more control on its own than
            this site does. This site also does not generate enough fake content to save anyone a meaningful amount of
            money or computing power if they were trying to create large quantities of fake news.</p>
        <p>Still, we believe that developers and researchers should carefully consider the ethical impact of
            their work. If you have concerns about this site, please <a href="/contact">contact us.</a></p>
        <br>
        <p><b>How does the site work?</b></p>
        <p>To generate articles, this site uses the Grover Mega model from <a
                href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.12616.pdf">Zellers et
            al.</a> Throughout the day, the site pulls real headlines from the internet and uses them to seed
            Grover so that it generates fake articles on subjects in today’s headlines. To generate op-eds and other
            commentary, the site seeds Grover with editorials and configures it to produce text in the style of outlets
            with strong political leanings. </p>

        <p>Once the site generates an article, it matches that article with an image using <a
                href="https://cse.google.com/cse/">Google’s custom search engine API</a>.</p>

                Recent advances in artificial intelligence have made it easy to generate believable fake text, including
                the articles on this site. We hope to demonstrate how this technology could automate
                disinformation and potentially flood the internet with fake news.<br>
